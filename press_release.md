## Vigil: Flexible Automation for the People Who Know the Work Best

*A workflow builder that empowers violation processing teams to create, customize, and launch their own automated processes—no engineering queue required*

---

Today we announce **Vigil**, a new internal workflow builder platform that empowers violation processing teams to create their own automated workflows using simple, modular building blocks. With Vigil, tasks that once required months of engineering work and complex configuration can now be assembled by the people closest to the work—in a fraction of the time.

## The Problem: 9 months to onboard a new state and 50% of operations done outside our core software

Onboarding a new state partner currently takes six to nine months. Florida alone required nine months because we had to manually modify our citation pipeline to accommodate their specific requirements. Meanwhile, the existing system has ballooned to over 235 configuration settings per partner, most of which exist to serve only a handful of use cases. The result is a brittle, unmaintainable system that still doesn't do what users need.

The evidence is in how people actually work: an estimated 50 to 80 percent of correspondence around violations is handled manually—through spreadsheets, external tools, and ad-hoc workarounds—because our current software simply doesn't support the workflows our teams require. This represents potentially thousands of human hours lost every month to tasks that should be automated.

## The Solution: Build What You Need, When You Need It

Vigil is a workflow builder that lets non-technical users assemble automated processes from a library of modular steps—like connecting building blocks. Need to generate a document from a template, route it for manual review, calculate fines based on custom rules, and then mail it? Connect the steps, configure the details, and launch.

With Vigil, if all required modules already exist, a new partner workflow can be configured in **minutes**. If new modules need to be developed, the timeline drops from months to **weeks**. Users gain the power to solve their own problems without waiting in an engineering queue.

## Leadership Perspective

> *"For too long, we've asked our operations teams to work around software limitations instead of building software that works for them. Vigil represents a fundamental shift in how we think about our internal tools. Instead of a rigid system that requires engineering intervention for every new requirement, we're investing in a flexible platform that puts control where it belongs—in the hands of the people who understand the work best. This isn't just a new tool; it's a strategic capability that will let us move at the speed our partners and our business demand."*

**— Jordan Placeholder, VP of Operations**

## How It Works

Vigil presents users with a visual canvas where workflows are built by connecting modular steps in sequence. Each workflow begins with a configurable trigger—the event that starts the process:

- **Time-based triggers** — "30 days after notice sent" or "every Monday at 8 AM"
- **Event-based triggers** — "when a payment is received" or "when a violation is created"
- **Workflow-generated triggers** — events emitted by other workflows, enabling powerful workflow chaining

Once triggered, the workflow executes a sequence of steps. The platform launches with a core set of modules, with more added over time based on user needs. Examples include:

- **Generate Document** — create letters, notices, or forms from configurable templates
- **Send Correspondence** — mail documents physically or digitally
- **Manual Review** — route items to a team member for approval or decision
- **Calculate Fines** — apply rules-based logic to determine amounts
- **Conditional Routing** — branch workflows based on specific conditions
- *...and more* — new modules developed as needs emerge

The platform is designed to be extensible. New modules can be developed and added to the library as requirements evolve, making Vigil more powerful over time rather than more complex.

## From the Front Lines

> *"I've been processing camera violations for four years, and I've spent more time in spreadsheets than I'd like to admit. When a partner has a unique requirement—like a different appeal window or a specific letter format—we either wait months for a system change or we handle it manually. With Vigil, I was able to build a workflow for our newest partner's hearing notice process in an afternoon. I configured the templates, set up the approval routing, and it just works. For the first time, I feel like the tools are actually designed for how we do our jobs."*

**— Alex Exampleson, Violation Processing Specialist**

## Getting Started

Vigil will be rolled out strategically, beginning with workflows that can be implemented in isolation from the existing system. This approach lets us deliver value quickly while avoiding the complexity of maintaining parallel systems.

**Initial adoption will focus on:**

1. **New partner onboarding** — partners joining the platform go directly into Vigil, avoiding integration with legacy configuration entirely
2. **Simple, isolated workflows** — existing processes that operate independently and can be migrated without cross-system dependencies
3. **High-volume manual workarounds** — spreadsheet-based processes that represent immediate automation opportunities
